> [!CAUTION]
> This is an **unofficial bot** that **uses unofficial APIs**,
> so you take all the responsibility for any consequences of running the bot,
> for example, account or IP bans.

> [!WARNING]
> The version `2.x` is not well-tested yet.

> [!NOTE]
> I realize the documentation is not complete â€“ this is not a deliberate choice,
> but rather the best I could do given the limited resources.
> I strive to maintain and improve it over time.
